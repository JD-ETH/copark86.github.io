During my time at Swiss Drone startup Flyability, the company supported me and my collegues from work to build a experimental platform. In here we have a simple object avoidance system using just the 2D scanning Laser from RPLidar A2.

Code available at [github](https://github.com/JD-ETH/erle_nuclear).
