I chose the approach of Rapid Trajectory generation with Model Predictive Control. 

I took part in the Game of Drones competition organized by Microsoft at NeuRIPS 2019, and won [2.place](https://microsoft.github.io/AirSim-NeurIPS2019-Drone-Racing/leaderboard_final.html) at tier 1.
See final results in video [AirSim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38j50BZxACM).
Also I made a video presentation for the conference: [Presentation NeuRIPS2019 Youtube](https://youtu.be/BcZcqiE-hyc)

The implementation is open sourced in my GitHub [repo](https://github.com/JD-ETH/AirSimNeurIPS).
